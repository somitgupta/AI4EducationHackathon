    "### 3.a Install Jupyter Notebook on your device\n",
    "Sure, let's walk through the setup of Jupyter Notebook as well as its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook largely depends on Python and pip (Python's default package manager). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 0. Open Command Prompt/Terminal:\n",
    "- If you're using Windows, type `cmd` in the search bar and press Enter.\n",
    "- On a Mac, open Terminal by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.\n",
    "- If you're on Linux, you can open the Terminal from System Tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Checking if Python is installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type this command in your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) to check if Python is already installed on your system:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If Python is correctly installed, you should see a response indicating the Python version. \n",
    "\n",
    "If Python is not installed, you will need to install it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Windows/Mac, download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "- For Linux, you can install it via terminal with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please note that with the installation of Python, pip is also installed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Checking if pip is installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type this command to check if pip is installed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "If pip is correctly installed, you will see a response showing the pip version.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pip is not installed, you can type the following command in Windows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python get-pip.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "For Mac and Linux, use the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo easy_install pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Step 3. Update pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "Always ensure to have the latest pip version. Use this command to upgrade pip:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4. Installing Jupyter Notebook and OpenAI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have confirmed the installation of Python and pip, you can install Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install notebook, openai, os\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Launch Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate Jupyter Notebook, type the following command and press Enter:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "Your default web browser should automatically open with the Jupyter Notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpoint: Validate Jupyter Notebook is working:\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly and working as expected, try creating a new Python notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Press the 'New' button on the right-hand side of the Jupyter Notebook interface and select Python 3 from the drop-down list.\n",
    "2. If a new notebook opens, then Jupyter Notebook was successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you should have Jupyter Notebook installed and ready to use on your device."
